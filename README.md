Tiny macOS floating textbox. Run saved prompts on selected text (from any app or manual input), auto-copy the result.

## Why

I keep editing more of my writing through LLMs. Tried voice (Handy is installed), kept drifting back to typing: voice felt like it was sending too much noise into the model. Probably because I write better than I think out loud, and I still don't write well enough.

Other reason: typing long prompts into CLI agents like Codex or Claude Code, then losing the whole thing to a stray keystroke that wipes the input, a crash, or accidentally killing the terminal. Not undoable, gone. Retypo writes every keystroke to `draft.txt` and snapshots up to 20 paused-state versions of the draft, so the worst case is reopening the panel and picking a snapshot from Settings.

## Caveats

- macOS 13+, Swift 5.9+, Xcode CLT or Xcode.
- Selection import (`Cmd+Shift+Space` from another app) needs Accessibility permission. Grant once when prompted; pick `build-dev/RetypoAir-dev.app`.
- Terminal prompt import for Codex/Claude Code uses the terminal's accessible text buffer and is on by default.
- VS Code integrated terminal import is experimental and on by default in Settings. It briefly opens VS Code Accessible View with `Option+F2`, reads the buffer through Accessibility, then presses `Esc`.
- BYO API key. One of Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # add at least one *_API_KEY. Load order: shell env, .env in CWD, ~/.retypo-air/.env. First wins.
scripts/dev-app.sh         # builds + opens build-dev/RetypoAir-dev.app
```

In Settings, pick a provider and click Refresh to load its models.

## Features

- One global shortcut. `Cmd+Shift+Space` in, edit, out.
- Easy go-and-back: hide restores focus to the app you came from.
- Selection import from any app.
- Codex/Claude Code prompt import from terminal windows without manual selection.
- 13 pre-made prompts. Freeform mode: type the prompt live each run.
- Auto-copy and auto-correct.
- Inline or stacked diff. Changed words underlined green.
- History, restorable. Don't lose your drafts.
- Undo/redo.
- Whitespace and newlines trimmed off LLM replies.
- macOS native spellcheck still works underneath.
- 2 Themes: Glass, Lighter. 
- Always-on-top.
- Automatic show on active screen for multi-screen setups.
- Multi-provider: Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter.
- Per-mode and per-model shortcuts.
- Cost tracking: last, session, today. Editable per-model pricing.
- Footer stats: WPM, changed-word delta, char count.
- Auto-correct skips short text, code fences, shell commands, symbol-heavy lines. So it never rewrites a command you're typing.

## Modes (saved prompts)

A mode is a saved system prompt. **Freeform** is special: type the prompt live each run (popup on Enter, type, Enter to apply).

Built-in: Correct, Typos & Grammar, Improve Writing, Translate, Simplify, Summarize, Bullets, Better way of saying, Make this Tweet Fit, Generate 3 variations, How to respond 3 ways, Caveman, **Freeform**.

Edit, rename, disable, shortcut-bind in Settings. Stored in `~/.retypo-air/modes.json`.

## External import precedence

When `Cmd+Shift+Space` from another app:

1. **AX selection**. Fast, no clipboard touched. Native macOS apps.
2. **Accessible terminal buffer**. Parses the focused terminal's visible text for Claude/Codex composer semantics.
3. **Experimental VS Code Accessible View**. Enabled by default (`experimentalVSCodeAccessibleViewImport` in `settings.json` or Settings UI). Sends `Option+F2`, reads the Accessible View, then sends `Esc`.
4. **Synthetic `Cmd+C`** via AX-pressed Copy menu. Clipboard read then restored. Terminals, TUIs.
5. **Existing clipboard**. Whatever was already copied.

If a draft already exists, asks before replacing. Failures: `~/.retypo-air/import-debug.log`.

## Keyboard

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Cmd+Shift+Space` | Show/hide panel (global). From another app: also imports selection, visible terminal prompt, or clipboard |
| `Cmd+Shift+Enter` | Run all enabled modes against current draft |
| `Enter` | Run current mode, auto-copy |
| `Shift+Enter` | New line |
| `Esc` | Hide panel |
| `Cmd+D` | Toggle Candidates overlay |
| `Cmd+S` | Toggle Settings |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Cycle focus: editor, footer |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` / `Left` / `Right` | Nav within footer, Candidates, Settings |
| `Cmd+1`...`Cmd+0` | Pick a mode (default, editable) |
| `Cmd+Opt+]` / `Cmd+Opt+[` | Cycle accepted models |
| `Cmd+C/V/X/A`, `Cmd+Z`, `Shift+Cmd+Z` | Standard editing |
| `Option+Left/Right`, `Shift+Option+Left/Right` | Move/select by word |
| `Home` / `End` (`Cmd+` for doc) | Line/document boundaries |
| `Ctrl+U` / `Ctrl+K` / `Ctrl+Y` | Kill to line start/end, yank |
| `Cmd+Q` | Quit |

`Cmd+Shift+Space` is not Spotlight (`Cmd+Space`) or emoji viewer (`Ctrl+Cmd+Space`). A few apps may bind it but it's usually safe.

## Files (`~/.retypo-air/`)

## Contribute / quality

Pre-push hook runs `bin/quality`: SwiftLint, Periphery, tests, coverage. All ratcheted from `quality_thresholds.json`. See `QUALITY.md`.

```bash
bin/quality          # run all gates
bin/quality-bump     # ratchet baseline lower after improvements
swift test           # tests only
```
